# Front-End Developer

Front-end or mobile development involves building feature-rich web and mobile applications. Using popular front-end web or mobile frameworks including React, React Native, Vue, Angular, Iconic or iOS/Android, you can build the presentation layer of your app (e.g., the layout, the positioning of text and images, colors, fonts, buttons, etc.). You also work with backend APIs and services to add interactivity to your web or mobile application.

Using Amplify, you can use your existing front-end skillset to add cloud functionality into your application such as auth, data, analytics, push notifications, and more.
